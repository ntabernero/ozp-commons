Usage

 The following examples describe the basic usage of the CodeNarc plugin.

* Generate CodeNarc Report As Part of the Project Reports

  To generate the CodeNarc report as part of the Project Reports, add the
  CodeNarc plugin in the <<<\<reporting\>>>> section
  of your <<<pom.xml>>>.

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>codenarc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${projectVersion}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  Then, execute the site plugin to generate the report.

+-----+
mvn site
+-----+

* {Use a Different version of CodeNarc}

  To use a different version of CodeNarc to create your report you can use the 
  <<<\<codeNarcVersion\>>>> configuration parameter.
  You may need to use a different version of log4j or Groovy.  You can use either the 
  <<<\<groovyVersion\>>>> or <<<\<log4jVersion\>>>> configuration property to accommodate the dependency.
  Please see {{{http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/}CodeNarc}} for the dependencies.   

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>codenarc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${projectVersion}</version>
        <configuration>
          <codeNarcVersion>0.14</codeNarcVersion>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>

+-----+

  Then, execute the site plugin to generate the report.

+-----+
mvn site
+-----+

+-----+

  The same can be done from the command line with the following:
  mvn -Dcodenarc.codenarc.verion=0.14 site
